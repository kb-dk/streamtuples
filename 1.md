/* SAMPLE JSHELL FILE
==

This is an initial attempt to write a markdown document (github flavor)
which is usable as a JShell (Java 9+) save file, in order to see if
this can capture executabe code as documentation in the same way that 
Knuth envisioned with literate programming.  [Haskell has a good introduction](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming).

For now the simplest approach seems to be to have markdown inside Java comments
including the triple-backtick right before the comment ending, and then go
back into a Java comment to have the triple-backtick marker again.  For now Bird style
(which I like a lot) cannot be done as it requires source manipulation.

This mean that code sections will end with a `/*` and begin with a `*/`.  The latter can be 
turned into a comment header as comments can contain additional `/*`.

An actual example:

```jshelllanguage
/* Fake comment header! */

void h(String s) { System.out.println("s=" + s); }

/*  <- start of comment containing markdown triple-backtick.
```

Now here in markdown we can do anything allowed in a Java comment!

Lots of interesting stuff about the next snippet which 
1. is 
1. was
1. will be!


```jshelllanguage
/* markdown comment ends here -> */

h("12")

/* 
```
And finally a code block marked as Java to see if github renders it differently.

```java
/* JAVA SNIPPET - redefinition */

void h(String s) { System.out.println("RELOADED s=" + s); }
h(12)

/* 
```
/* end of script */
