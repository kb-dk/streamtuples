SAMPLE JSHELL FILE
==

This is an initial attempt to write a markdown document (github flavor)
which is usable as a JShell (Java 9+) save file, in order to see if
this can capture executabe code as documentation in the same way that 
Knuth envisioned with literate programming.  [Haskell has a good introduction](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming).

For now the simplest approach seems to be to have markdown inside Java comments
including the triple-backtick right before the comment ending, and then go
back into a Java comment to have the triple-backtick marker again.  For now Bird style
(which I like a lot) cannot be done as it requires source manipulation.

This mean that code sections will end with a comment start and begin with a 
comment end. The latter can be 
turned into a comment header as comments can contain additional comment starts.

**Note**: Initial testing indicates that JShell dislikes backpings around comment starts and
comment ends in comments.  The precise rules remain to be determined.

This document is an actual example.  Use

    cat 1.md | jshell -

to invoke from the command line.  Note that JShell discards comments when reading save files, so 
so don't save and reload this file.

First we define a small function which knows how to return a string telling what argument
it was given:

---

```jshelllanguage

/* Fake comment header! */

void h(String s) { System.out.println("s=" + s); }

/*  <- start of comment containing markdown triple-backtick.

```

---

Now here in markdown we can do anything allowed in a Java comment (except it appears the
JShell parser is slightly stricter)!

Lots of interesting stuff about the next snippet which 
1. is 
1. was
1. will be!


```jshelllanguage
/* markdown comment ends here -> */

h("12")

/* 
```
And finally a code block marked as Java to see if github renders it differently.

```java
/* JAVA SNIPPET - redefinition */

void h(String s) { System.out.println("RELOADED s=" + s); }
h("24")

/* 
```
/* end of script */
